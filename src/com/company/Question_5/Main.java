        /* ANSWER QUESTION HERE:
        Can be used to add extra details that may be needed for the other classes, but not in a way that they can be
        implemented. It's more like a system of documentation but in the form of a class. Without them, there would be
        more need to override things and generally having them saves time and effort.
